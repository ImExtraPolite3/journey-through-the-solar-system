# Journey Through the Solar System

This project was made in order simulate someone traveling through our solar system. This is achieved by allowing the veiwer from the start to feel as if they are in a sort of sci-fi enviroment. Through the use of font, animations, and a horizontal scroll that attempt simulate our Solar System, the veiwer should feel as if they are in space.

Using Figma I was able to somewhat picture how the horizonatal scroll would look. It also helped give a birds eye view of how the project would without the constaint of a computer screen. 

 **Features**

Within this project I made use of the gsap library in order to make animation that would be tedious if I tried to do them on my own. For example, the dynamic changing of the main heading and the horizontal scroll. I also impletmented CSS that I did on my own such as the hovering animation on the button as well as the rockets that fly across the page when the start journey is clicked. I also made use of sounds that go along with the rockets in order to help spread the feeling of taking off into space. The images of the are links that lead to YouTube videos that show what the planets sound like. In order to show that they are links I add a hover animation which reduces the opacity as well as increase the scale of the image.
