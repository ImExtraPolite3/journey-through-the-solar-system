    'Despite not being the closest to the Sun, Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system, with surface temperatures averaging around 900°F (475°C), hot enough to melt lead. This is due to a runaway greenhouse effect in its thick atmosphere.',
    'Venus’s atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide (96.5%), with clouds of sulfuric acid. This dense atmosphere traps heat and creates enormous surface pressure—about 92 times that of Earth’s, equivalent to being 3,000 feet underwater.',
    'Venus rotates in the opposite direction to most planets in the solar system, a phenomenon known as "retrograde rotation." It spins from east to west, meaning the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east.',
    'A day on Venus (one full rotation) is longer than its year. Venus takes 243 Earth days to complete one rotation, while its orbit around the Sun takes 225 Earth days.',
    'Like Mercury, Venus has no moons or rings.',
    'Venus has more volcanoes than any other planet, with over 1,600 major volcanic features. Many are believed to still be active.',
    'Venus has only a very weak magnetic field, unlike Earth’s strong magnetic shield, which protects us from solar radiation.',
